# Arduino wooden clock

The source code and plans for a wooden clock running on an [Arduino Mega 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) board. The time signal comes from Germany's [DCF77 station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77) using a low cost receiver.

## State of the project
**This project is not finished yet and in the next weeks more code & schematics will come. At the end, the code will get restructured in a way that it can be used in other projects as well and more easily understood.** (_Date: Sept. 2017_)

## Tools

The schematics are build with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/). 
The code can be run with the official [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (tested with v1.8.4).
